\begin{document}
Let $X=\lbrace X_t \rbrace_{t\geq 0}$ be a process satisfying the following condition$\colon$
For all $T>0$ there exist positive constants $\alpha$, $\beta$, $D$ such that  
$$ E[|X_t-X_s|^{\alpha}]\leq D|t-s|^{1+\beta} \,\,\ 0\leq s, t\leq T.$$
\\Then there exists a continuous modification of $X$.
